# Rudimentary Physics Engine

Implementing a basic physics system for future projects.

## To Do:
- [ ] Implement friction in system.
- [ ] Add interactable objects
     
## Tutorials Used:
1. [Creating a Physics Engine Series by Randy Gaul](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/series/how-to-create-a-custom-physics-engine--gamedev-12715)

    Forms the fundamental basis behind my simple physics engine.
    
2. [Drawing Object Trails by the Coding Train Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqE8DMfOajk)

    Enables me to draw a trailing line to denote the path of my Particle object.
